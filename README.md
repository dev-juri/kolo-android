## kolo-android

Android app demo of the kolo-be project.

## Description

The idea was inspired by my family's tradition of using a stash box, commonly known as "Kolo" in
Yoruba, where everyone puts money at will and withdraws funds whenever urgent needs arise, such as
needing cash to get to the nearest POS/ATM, running errands, or handling family-related tasks.

## Stack

- Backend: [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
- Database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Android app: Kotlin, XML, RoomDB, Hilt, Retrofit, Jetpack Navigation Components, and other jetpack
  libraries.

## Kolo's documentation

The available endpoints have been documented [here](https://kolo-3yf4.onrender.com/api) using
